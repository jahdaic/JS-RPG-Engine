# JavaScript RPG Engine

![](http://pre07.deviantart.net/5eaf/th/pre/f/2011/095/8/7/generic_rpg_roughs_by_supahbuttahtoast-d3dbopo.jpg)

This project is a fun experiment to create a pure JavaScript object-oriented RPG engine that could potentially be used to build a much larger game. Work orignally began on this for a game I was building for the Pebble smartwatch, but with the closing of Pebble it has now been decoupled from Pebble SDK.

The code is written entirely in pure JavaScript with no other dependencies, but the demo page does include jQuery, Bootstrap and Font Awesome from MaxCDN for the sake of a nicer looking UI.

This project is a personal project with no real goal or timeframe, but any help or suggestions would always be appreciated.
