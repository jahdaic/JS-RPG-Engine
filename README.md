# JavaScript RPG Engine

![](http://pre07.deviantart.net/5eaf/th/pre/f/2011/095/8/7/generic_rpg_roughs_by_supahbuttahtoast-d3dbopo.jpg)

This project is a generic object-oriented RPG engine that can be used to build a much larger game. It was originally created for a game I was building for Pebble smartwatch, but with the closing of Pebble has now been converted to plain JS.

The code is written entirely in plain JavaScript with no other dependencies, but the demo page does include jQuery, Bootstrap and Font Awesome from MaxCDN for the sake of a nicer looking UI.

This project is a personal project with no real goal or timeframe, but any help or suggestions would always be appreciated.
